Orbot: Android Onion Routing Robot
***********************************************
Freedom is a freely licensed open-source application developed for the
Android platform. It acts as a front-end to the Tor binary application,
and also provides an HTTP Proxy for connecting web browsers and other
HTTP client applications into the Tor SOCKS interface.

*** PreReqs ***
You need the Android Developer SDK to compile and build the APK file:
http://developer.android.com/
The project files including in this distribution are meant to be used
with Eclipse: http://eclipse.org/

*** How to use ***
Currently, Freedom will work with any application that supports using
an HTTP or SOCKS Proxy. Once you start Tor using Freedom, you can then
point your application to HTTP port 8118 or SOCKS port 9050 on localhost
IP 127.0.0.1.

If you have root access, and a version of Android with iptables that
supports the netfilter owner module, then Freedom can setup transparent
proxying for any application.

Finally, Firefox on Android is available, and we have released an
add-on named ProxyMob for configuring SOCKS proxy settings for use
with the local Tor socks proxy.

** A Few Notes **

To ensure you are connected to the Tor network, you should browse to
https://check.torproject.org/

The first time you activate Freedom, it may take a while to connect to
Tor. Check the message log to ensure you are "100% Bootstrapped".
